This desktop app is a word memorization trainer.
The application has file and client-server modes of operation.
In the folder "artifactes" there is a ready-made exe file.

The first time you run it, a "DataText" folder will be created that contains excel tables.
In the table "words.xls" it is necessary to fill in the words/questions and their answers/values.
In the "motivationtext.xls" table, you can optionally fill in phrases for motivation that the bear will tell you.

The file "Configs" will also be created, in this file you can configure the client-server mode, configure the connection settings and the bear talk timeout.
It is necessary to create tables in the database with the structure of already created tables in the "DataText" folder for the client-server mode to work correctly
